CAYMAN Register Viewer
====

A small something to make navigating the register list less confusing. Can be
viewed [here](https://docs.bob131.so/cayman-regs/).

I wouldn't recommend actually looking at the source code contained within. It's
about as janky and hacked-together as you can get. It's only intended as a means
to an end.

There's a LICENSE in here with the AGPLv3 text. Obviously, this doesn't apply to
the register listing nor the register document itself (property of AMD); It only
applies to the code and layout. Ordinarily I'd consider something as small and
simple as this to be public domain, but out of laziness I've included
[ViewerJS][ViewerJS] in-tree which may or may not make this repo a derivative
work.

Contains [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [ViewerJS][ViewerJS] and
[Split.js](https://nathancahill.github.io/Split.js/).

[ViewerJS]: http://viewerjs.org
